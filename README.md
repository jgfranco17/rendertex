## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before running Stockpyle, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

* [Python 3.9](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) or above
* pip package manager

Stockpyle is being developed on Ubuntu 22.04, but should work on MacOS or other Linux distros.

### Creating a Virtual Environment

It is recommended to create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). This will ensure that the working environment has all the necessary dependencies installed without conflicting with the base interpreter.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment named "venv"
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Installing

To get started with RenderTex, clone the repository to your local machine and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jgfranco17/rendertex.git
